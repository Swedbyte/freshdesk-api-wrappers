Freshdesk API wrappers library for Freshdesk web platform application.
To learn more about platform check out https://developers.freshdesk.com/v2/docs/your-first-app/

This edition uses Freshdesk's 'client' method to make requests to API and plugins to the web-page as class freshdeskApiKit at global scope.

If you need Freshdesk serverless, node.js, or native browser version of this lib check out other editions.

Installation:

1. Plug-in freshdesk-api-wrappers.js file (or minified version) to the web-page, e.g. '<script src="freshdesk-api-wrappers.js"></script>'

2. Important! To make Freshdesk 'client' available for freshdeskApiKit it is necessary to set 'client' in global scope after app.initialized()

    app.initialized().then(function(_client) {
        window.client = _client;
    });

3. Then initiate freshdeskApi lib as new instance of global-scoped class freshdeskApiKit('my.domain.name', 'apiKey', logging = bool)

    const freshdeskApi = new freshdeskApiKit(inputDomainName, inputApiKey, true);

4. All wrappers now accessible as promised-based methods of freshdeskApi

    freshdeskApi.getTicket(2333).then(data => {
            console.log(`getTicket received data: `, data);
    });
