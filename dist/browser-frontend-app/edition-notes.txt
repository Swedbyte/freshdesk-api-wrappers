This edition uses 'XMLHttpRequest' method to make requests to API and plugins to the web-page as class freshdeskApiKit at global scope.

Installation:

1. Plug-in freshdesk-api-wrappers.js file (or minified version) to the web-page, e.g. '<script src="freshdesk-api-wrappers.js"></script>'

3. Then initiate freshdeskApi lib as new instance of global-scoped class freshdeskApiKit('my.domain.name', 'apiKey', logging = bool)

    const freshdeskApi = new freshdeskApiKit(inputDomainName, inputApiKey, true);

4. All wrappers now accessible as promised-based methods of freshdeskApi

    freshdeskApi.getTicket(2333).then(data => {
            console.log(`getTicket received data: `, data);
    });
